Enhancing List Views with Pagination in a Web Application
Introduction:- 
Pagination is a common technique used in web development to split large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks for display. It allows users to navigate through different pages of content without overwhelming them with all the information at once. In this project, we will enhance list views in a web application by implementing pagination.
Goals:-
Implement pagination functionality for list views in the web application.
Improve user experience by breaking down large datasets into smaller, more digestible portions.
Enhance performance by reducing the amount of data loaded and displayed at once.
Provide easy navigation for users to browse through different pages of content.
Technologies Used:
